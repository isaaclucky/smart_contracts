  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Smart Contracts</b> are blockchain-based contracts that execute when a given agreement is satisfied. They can be used to deploy multiple types of agreements between entities. They ensure the agreement holds by excluding third-party interference in the execution of the contract.
    </li>
    <li>
    A network of computers executes the actions when predetermined conditions have been met and verified. These can entail paying out money to the right people, registering a car, sending out notices, or writing a ticket. When the transaction is finished, the blockchain is then updated. As a result, the transaction cannot be modified, and only parties to whom permission has been granted can view the outcome.
